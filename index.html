        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Shamim Ekramullah, a Biochemistry graduate from the University of Copenhagen, currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Biochemistry with a specialization in data science and analysis. My academic journey has been deeply rooted in protein science, cell biology, and biophysics, with a keen focus on biomedical image segmentation and machine learning applications for tracking proteins related to neurodegenerative diseases.

Proficient in R and Python, I have a robust skill set in bioinformatics, machine learning, and statistical analysis, which I leverage to solve complex biological challenges. My passion for biophysics, data science, neuroscience, and astrobiology drives my research and analytical pursuits.

Fluent in both Danish and English, I am approachable, eager to learn from others, and thrive in high-pressure situations, as demonstrated by my role as a goalkeeper in football. I believe in the power of teamwork and discipline, both on and off the pitch, and continuously strive to expand my knowledge and expertise.
